  abstract = {University professors traditionally struggle to incorporate software testing into their course curriculum. Worries include double-grading for correctness of both source and test code and finding time to teach testing as a topic. Test-driven development (TDD) has been suggested as a possible solution to improve student software testing skills and to realize the benefits of testing. According to most existing studies, TDD improves software quality and student productivity. This paper surveys the current state of TDD experiments conducted exclusively at universities. Similar surveys compare experiments in both the classroom and industry, but none have focused strictly on academia.},

TITLE = {Improved LiDAR Localization Method for Mobile Robots Based on Multi-Sensing},
JOURNAL = {Remote Sensing},
VOLUME = {14},
YEAR = {2022},
NUMBER = {23},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we propose a localization method applicable to 3D LiDAR by improving the LiDAR localization algorithm, such as AMCL (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization). The method utilizes multiple sensing information, including 3D LiDAR, IMU and the odometer, and can be used without GNSS. Firstly, the wheel speed odometer and IMU data of the mobile robot are multi-source fused by EKF (Extended Kalman Filter), and the sensor data obtained after multi-source fusion are used as the motion model to participate in the positional prediction of the particle set in AMCL to obtain the initial positioning information of the mobile robot. Then, the position pose difference values output by AMCL at adjacent moments are substituted into the PL-ICP algorithm as the initial position pose transformation matrix, and the 3D laser point cloud is aligned with the nonlinear system using the PL-ICP algorithm. The three-dimensional laser odometer is obtained by LM (Levenberg--Marquard) iterative solution in the PL-ICP algorithm. Finally, the initial position pose output by AMCL is corrected by the three-dimensional laser odometer, and the AMCL particles are weighted and sampled to output the final positioning result of the mobile robot. Through simulation and practical experiments, it is verified that the improved AMCL algorithm has higher positioning accuracy and stability compared to the AMCL algorithm.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm capable of generating smooth, feasible paths for an any-shape non-holonomic mobile robot, taking into account orientation restrictions, with the aim of navigating close to obstacles. Our contribution consists in an extension of the A* algorithm in a cell decomposition, where besides its position, the orientation of the platform is also considered when searching for a path. This is achieved by constructing 16 layers of orientations and only visiting neighbor layers when searching for the lowest cost. To simplify collision checking, the robot's footprint is used to inflate obstacles, yet, to allow the robot to find paths close to obstacles, the actual footprint of the robot must used. By discretizing the orientation space into layers and computing an oriented footprint for each layer, the actual footprint of the robot is used, increasing the configuration space without becoming computationally expensive. The path planning algorithm was developed under the EU-funded project CARLoS1 and was implemented in a stud welding robot simulated within a naval industry environment, validating our approach.},
